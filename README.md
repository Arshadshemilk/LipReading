# LipNet
LipNet is an AI project that uses TensorFlow to develop a lipreading system. Implemented as a Streamlit web app, it analyzes lip movements in videos to recognize spoken language. Users can upload videos or use their webcam, and the app displays the predicted words, making lipreading accessible and user-friendly.
